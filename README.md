# Jets Project

##Description
I have a fleet of jets: Fighter jet, Cargo plane, Luxury jet, Ufo Boom, and SkyTanic. There is a class for each & two implementation methods: Cargo Carrier and Combat Ready. In Cargo Carrier, you can load cargo & the method in the Jets Application will let you know how much cargo you have loaded. In Combat Ready, you will be able to load ammo on the fighter jet & in the method in Jets Application, it will let you know how many rounds of ammo you have loaded & relay motivating messages depending on the aircraft! User will be able to add/remove jets as well as display all jets in the fleet. 


##Lessons Learned

*Understanding that Jet is an abstract class took some trial and error. Since I couldn't directly call methods from the Jet class, I spent more time trying to find a work around. 

* The AirField class was also a little challenging when calling for my array list that held my list of jets from my jets.txt. 

*Adding to my interface methods was very interesting.


##Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Google


##What I Enjoyed

I enjoyed finally getting a switch statement to work & calling the methods from the switch statement. Also, the interface utilization was pretty cool. I look forward to working with interfaces more in the future.
